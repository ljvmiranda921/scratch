# ü™ê Weasel Project: Am I smarter than a text generator?

Some Prodigy annotation tasks to try out some common LLM benchmarks
First, you need to download the dataset and specify the annotation interface (choice/textbox) it will be converted into.

```sh
weasel run setup . --vars.dataset piqa --vars.interface choice
```

Then, you can run [Prodigy](https://prodigy.ai) to start annotating:

```sh
weasel run annotate . --vars.dataset piqa --vars.interface choice
```

This saves all your annotations to the `humaneval_{dataset}_{interface}`
Prodigy dataset, which you can then export using [`prodigy db-out`](https://prodi.gy/docs/recipes#db-out) command.
