        "Passage: Food can be traded in the futures market before harvest. If the grain output is predicted to be insufficient, the price of grain futures will rise; if the grain harvest is predicted, the price of grain futures will fall. This morning, meteorologists predicted that there will be much-needed rainfall in the grain-producing areas starting tomorrow. Therefore, since sufficient moisture is very important for the survival of the current cereals, today's cereal futures prices will drop significantly.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, weakens the above view most seriously?\nChoices:\nA. There will be no bumper crops at the critical pollination stage without receiving enough moist grain.\nB. The fluctuation of cereal futures prices in this quarter is more severe than in the previous quarter.\nC. Meteorologists predict that tomorrow \u2019s rainfall estimates are likely to extend beyond the grain-producing areas.\nD. Agricultural experts announced today that a pathogen that has destroyed some cereal crops will spread more widely before the end of the growing season.\nAnswer:",
