Determine whether the text below is a supporting argument (Argument_for),
opposing argument (Argument_against), or none (NoArgument) regarding the topic
of "minimum wage." First, identify the premise and the claim, then determine if
the reasons or evidence presented in the argument are in favor of the claim,
against the claim, or irrelevant to the claim. Answer in the following format:

answer: <Argument_for, Argument_against, or NoArgument>

Below are some examples

Text:
"""
Or instead of hiring fewer employees , the company may start outsourcing jobs to
employees in countries that are willing to work for much less than $ 10.10 per
hour , resulting in fewer jobs for Americans ."
"""

answer: Argument_against
reason: The premise of the text is that if the minimum wage is increased to $10.10 per
hour, then companies may start outsourcing jobs to countries where employees are
willing to work for much less, leading to fewer jobs for Americans. This is an
argument against increasing the minimum wage. Therefore the answer is Argument_against.
